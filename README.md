# Welcome to TRAVELFIX 🌍✈️
Project Overview


TravelFix is a website dedicated to travel enthusiasts, created by three friends: Olivia, Marvin, and Yona. Each of us has chosen to share our love for a country close to our hearts: Guadeloupe, Japan, and Greece. This project was developed as part of our web development studies.
